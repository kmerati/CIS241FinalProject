	 <p class="pref">I really enjoyed taking <a href="http://catalog.edcc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=53&poid=10643&returnto=15073#" style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank">CIS 241</a> this quarter. While I have some experience in web development years ago, I was able to learn more of what is relevant today. I would identify myself as a &quot;beginner coder.&quot; I haven&#39;t touched code in a long while, and I was surprised to see how quickly everything came back for me. It was like I picked up, right where I left off.</p>
	  
	  <p class="pref"> I liked learning about all the components of web development and how they all worked together. The textbook and the exams really helped me to understand web development more. 
The labs were thorough and helped me to fully understand how to code properly. It was definitely a learning experience for me as there were some challenges that I had to overcome.</p>
  <p class="pref">
  My biggest &quot;Aha Moment&quot; this quarter was when I found out how to use a GUI properly. In my recent experience with web development, I used Adobe Dreamweaver, but never truly understood what it was used best for. I had the opportunity to use the GUI to make tables on my resume page. It was much easier and saved a lot of time by doing it on the GUI versus manually typing it in.

   Louis has been a fantastic instructor. He is very responsive and is willing to help. Anytime I had questions about a project or just needed to talk, he made himself available to me. This has been a truly eye-opening quarter for me. I enjoyed expanding my knowledge about the basics of web development and I am excited to start my next quarter!
